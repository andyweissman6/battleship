Written Reflection:

Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to 1. Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
  -We started by creating a game class.  After running into some issues with our require for the runner file we phoned an instructor to help troubleshoot. Dani was able to help us solve the issue, while also giving us the idea to create a player class that held a board object. Though we didn't have an interaction pattern we understood that we had created most things in previous classes/iteration that we could work with to bulid out the functionality. Then we took a look at the functionality checklist and copied that into our game class file. Under each bit we psuedo coded and chose past methods and objects that we thought might be useful to help build that functionality.

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

-refactor some methods to help dry up, maybe implement some modules or inheritance where it might make sense.  Try to create a dynamic method for selecting consecutive/valid coordinates. 

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
- 99% was driver/navigator.  Any async work included design modifications or slight refactors. 

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

-At the end of each day of work we would do a short reflection and run through what we wanted to work on next. Usually feedback was shared at that time.
